# Explorer Bookmark for VS Code

Ever got lost in a huge repo, with no imaginable way back to the files you originally worked on?
<br />
Say goodbye to endless scrolling trying to find those files after losing where they were.
<br />
<br />
Explorer Bookmark succeeds in making a quick-access explorer view. Adding often used folders or files to this cache-like structure makes traversing big projects just a bit less of a hassle.
